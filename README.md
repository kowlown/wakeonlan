# Wake-On-Lan

## Description
I created this project because there was a lack of working tool allowing me to send a magick packet to my computer in order to wake it. There was some online tools who were working but stopped, some were there are tons of annoying ads. And my favorite just disappeared.
So there was a need, I fixed it. It's not online, because I don't want to pay for the hosting. The source code is there, you can compile it easily.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
I will provide a zip and an installer in the future

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you have an issue you can create a ticket on the issue board of the project : https://gitlab.com/kowlown/wakeonlan/-/issues

## Roadmap
I consider the project as complete since it is doing its job. Thus, I have no Roadmap. If you have an idea, you can create an issue, and we may discuss it.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.
